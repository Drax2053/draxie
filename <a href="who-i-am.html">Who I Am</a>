    <h1>Who I Am</h1>
    <p>So for starters, for those who are wondering, I'm 17 years old, and I have a deep passion for technology, gaming, and coding. Ever since I was younger, I’ve been fascinated by how things work, which led me to explore the world of coding. I started with basic programming and gradually moved on to more complex languages and projects. Whether I’m creating something for fun or diving into a project for school, coding has become more than just a hobby—it’s a passion that pushes me to think critically, solve problems, and constantly learn new things. I love the idea of building something from scratch, seeing it come together, and making it functional. Coding is like a puzzle, and I enjoy piecing together the perfect solution, whether it's a small script or a large-scale web application.</p>

    <p>In addition to coding, I’m really into gaming, particularly games like Roblox and Minecraft. These platforms allow me to not only play but also create, explore, and collaborate with friends. They serve as my playgrounds for creativity, where I can design my own worlds, explore new challenges, and learn about game mechanics and development. Gaming has always been more than just entertainment for me; it’s a way to express myself, test my problem-solving skills, and connect with others. The gaming community has been a big part of my journey, and through online play, I’ve built lasting friendships and learned a lot about teamwork, strategy, and communication.</p>

    <p>Right now, I’m a high school student balancing academics with my passions for technology and gaming. It’s not always easy, but I’ve learned to stay organized and make time for everything I care about. Schoolwork comes first, but I always find a way to make room for coding projects, gaming, and my other interests. As a high schooler, I’m constantly looking for ways to improve myself, not just in the classroom but in everything I do. I push myself to learn new things every day—whether it’s experimenting with new coding techniques, diving deeper into a game’s mechanics, or exploring new hobbies outside of my usual interests. I firmly believe that learning should never stop, and I aim to always be growing and evolving.</p>

    <p>In addition to my academics, I’m involved in my school’s esports team, where I play Overwatch as a Junker Queen tank. Esports has taught me a lot about discipline, focus, and teamwork. Competing at a high level requires constant practice, strategic thinking, and collaboration with teammates. It’s not just about being the best individual player; it’s about understanding how to work with others and achieve a common goal. Esports has given me the chance to be part of something bigger than myself, and it’s helped me improve my leadership and communication skills. I love the thrill of competition, and being part of a team gives me a sense of purpose and belonging.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding, gaming, or studying, I try to stay active by exploring new interests and staying involved in my community. I believe that learning should be shared, which is why I often teach others about technology and coding whenever I get the chance. Helping others understand the concepts that I’m passionate about is a rewarding experience. I also enjoy taking on creative projects, whether it's building websites or collaborating on new ideas. My ultimate goal is to combine my skills in coding, gaming, and creativity to make a positive impact on the world. I want to create something meaningful, whether it's a game, a piece of software, or a new idea that can help people in some way. I'm excited for the future and all the possibilities that come with it, and I’m determined to keep pushing myself to learn and grow every day.</p>
