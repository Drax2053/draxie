<h1> Who i am</h1>

<p> My name’s Drax, and I’m a 17-year-old with a deep passion for technology, gaming, and coding. Ever since I was young, I’ve been fascinated by how things work, whether it’s the mechanics behind a game, the structure of a website, or the inner workings of software. That curiosity has driven me to learn more about coding, game development, and everything in between.

Gaming is a huge part of my life. I love immersing myself in different worlds, whether it’s through Roblox, Minecraft, or fast-paced competitive games. Overwatch is one of my main games, and I’m proud to be a part of my school’s esports team, where I take on the role of a Junker Queen tank. Playing in a team environment has taught me a lot about strategy, communication, and adapting to different challenges—skills that go beyond just gaming.

Outside of gaming, I spend a lot of time coding and working on projects that allow me to bring my ideas to life. I enjoy experimenting with different programming languages and tools, constantly pushing myself to learn and improve. Right now, I’m also working on building my personal portfolio website, where I can showcase my projects, skills, and interests.

Balancing school, gaming, and coding can be a challenge, but I love what I do. When I’m not deep in a coding project or practicing for esports, I like to stay active by exploring new hobbies and staying engaged with my community. I believe in always pushing myself to grow, whether it’s by learning a new skill, tackling a challenging game, or stepping outside my comfort zone.

This website is just one step in my journey, and I’m excited to keep expanding it as I continue to develop new skills and take on new challenges. If you’re interested in gaming, coding, or tech in general, feel free to connect with me—I’m always up for a good conversation!
