<p>I prefer the name Drax over Joey, which is what my parents call me. While they'll always use that name, I ask that you call me Drax as a friend who respects my feelings. My parents love and support me in all my decisions.</p>

<p>I also want to share that I identify as bisexual and believe the world needs more love. I feel deeply and have a big heart. I strive to be a good person and a loyal friend.</p>

<p>If you think we’d get along, I’d love to hear from you. It would be a pleasure to meet you.</p>
