<p>So for starters, for those who are wondering, I'm 17 years old. I love coding, whether it's for fun or as part of my projects. I also enjoy playing games like Roblox and Minecraft, where I can explore, create, and have fun with friends. Right now, I'm a high schooler, balancing schoolwork, gaming, and my passion for technology. I'm always looking to learn new things and improve my skills, whether it's in coding, gaming, or just life in general. Outside of school, I stay busy with my esports team, where I play Overwatch as a Junker Queen tank. It’s challenging, but I thrive on competition and teamwork. When I’m not gaming or coding, you’ll probably find me experimenting with new ideas or hanging out with my friends. I'm passionate about creating things</p>
